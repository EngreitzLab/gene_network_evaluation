# `datasets`

This directory contains the starting objects for running the full inference/evaluation/dashboard pipeline. These objects are separated into subdirectories by dataset (e.g. [`datasets/Endothelial/`](datasets/Endothelial/)).

Each directory should have the starting h5mu file containing the `data_key` as a minimum, but can also contain things like E2G links or perturbation metadata. See the [main README.md](../../README.md) for more information on the input formats for inference.
